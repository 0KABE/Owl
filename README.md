## Document

Code document is generated by `Doxygen` which is the de facto standard tool for generating documentation from annotated C++ sources.

To generate documentation, you should install requirement programs:

* Doxygen
* Graphviz

After all requirement programs installed, just run the following command to generate the documentation

```commandline
doxygen
```
